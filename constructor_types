//3 types of constructors:1.default 2.parameterized 3.copy
/*NOTE:For constructors
  -constructor is also a function that is defined inside a class which does'nt hold any void or return type.
  -constructor is called only once when an object is created.
  -name of constructor is same as class name.
  -In c++ copy constructors are by default but in java copy constructors are user-defined.
