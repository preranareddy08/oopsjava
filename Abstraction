/*ABSTRACTION
 -abstract keyword is used before class.
 -In an abstract class methods can be abstract and non-abstract.
 -for an abstract method,implementation is not required.
 -It cannot be instantiated.
 -It can have constructors and static methods also.
 -It can have final methods which will force the subclass not to change the body of the method.
